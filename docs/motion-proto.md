# `zmk.motion` — RPC contract for the IMU features

Covers the two PH60SCV2EVO (LIS2DH12) features and the one ES60 change. The
Studio frontend is already written against this contract; see
`src/motion/motionRpc.ts` for the TypeScript mirror and
`src/demo/motionBackend.ts` for a working reference implementation of the state
machine.

## Why one new subsystem, not two

ES60's frame button is **per-layer**, which makes it an ordinary key position:
per-layer bindings, undo/redo, unsaved-change tracking and the binding picker
all already exist in the `keymap` subsystem. A dedicated subsystem for it would
re-implement that machinery and force Studio to carry two different mental
models of "a key". So it needs no new proto at all — just two optional fields
(below) and a kscan entry.

The IMU features are genuinely device-level state with their own lifecycle, so
they get their own subsystem.

## 1. `keymap.proto` — two optional fields (ES60)

```proto
enum KeyKind {
  KEY_KIND_MATRIX      = 0;
  KEY_KIND_SIDE_BUTTON = 1;
  KEY_KIND_ENCODER     = 2;
}

message KeyPhysicalAttrs {
  // … existing width/height/x/y/r/rx/ry …
  optional KeyKind kind  = 8;  // omit for matrix keys
  optional string  label = 9;  // short name, e.g. "Side"
}
```

Firmware then reports the frame button as a normal key position in
`get_physical_layouts` / `get_keymap`, with `kind = KEY_KIND_SIDE_BUTTON`. Old
firmware omits both fields and Studio renders exactly as it does today, so this
is backward compatible in both directions.

Studio reads these in one place only — `src/keyboard/keyMeta.ts`. If you pick
different field names, that file is the only edit.

Place it at coordinates that reflect the physical frame position; note Studio's
auto-fit zoom derives its bounding box from `max(x + width)`, so a position far
from the matrix shrinks the whole canvas.

## 2. `motion.proto` — new subsystem

Register it as a new field on `zmk.studio.Request` / `RequestResponse` /
`Notification` alongside `lighting` and `combos`.

Parameters are deliberately the raw LIS2DH12 register semantics rather than an
invented 1–5 "sensitivity" scale — otherwise firmware and UI both have to carry
a mapping table, and they will drift.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package zmk.motion;
import "keymap.proto";

message Request {
    oneof request_type {
        bool        get_capabilities = 1;

        CarryConfig set_carry_config = 5;
        bool        save_state       = 6;
        bool        set_live_stream  = 7;
    }
}

        bool         save_state       = 6;

    bool   supports_tap        = 2;

}

// Any binding may be omitted. When a single and its double are both set on
// the same side, the single fires one window late so the double can supersede.
message TapConfig {
    bool   enabled       = 1;
    uint32 threshold     = 2;  // CLICK_THS, shared by all taps
    uint32 time_limit_ms = 3;  // TIME_LIMIT
    uint32 latency_ms    = 4;  // TIME_LATENCY
    uint32 window_ms     = 5;  // TIME_WINDOW — second-tap / arbitration window
    zmk.keymap.BehaviorBinding left_single_binding  = 6;

    zmk.keymap.BehaviorBinding right_single_binding = 8;
    zmk.keymap.BehaviorBinding right_double_binding = 9;
    uint32 layer_mask    = 10;  // 0 = all layers
}

message CarryConfig {
    bool   enabled            = 1;
    uint32 motion_threshold   = 2;  // INT_THS for the any-motion interrupt
    uint32 motion_duration_ms = 3;  // walking must persist this long before sleep
}

enum Orientation {
    ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN   = 0;
    ORIENTATION_FLAT_UP   = 1;
    ORIENTATION_FLAT_DOWN = 2;
    ORIENTATION_TILTED    = 3;
}

message LiveState {
    // Peak acceleration within the push period, in the same raw counts the
    // threshold fields use, so a threshold marker can be drawn on the meter.
    uint32      magnitude      = 1;
    Orientation orientation    = 2;
    bool        carry_active   = 3;  // walking detected, sleep imminent
    bool        tap_detected   = 4;
    uint32      last_click_src = 5;  // raw CLICK_SRC of the last tap
}

message Notification {
    oneof notification_type {
        LiveState live_state = 1;
    }
}
```

### Behaviour notes

- **Carry sleep semantics.** A one-way trip, not a toggle: any-motion events
  build a streak; a gap of ~2 s or a key press resets it. Sustained movement
  for `motion_duration_ms` sends the keyboard to System OFF (the normal ZMK
  sleep path, watchdog-fed). Waking is a key press, exactly like the idle
  timeout — there is no unlock message because nothing is locked, it was
  asleep.
- **Tap sides.** The LIS2DH12 click engine reports which direction the case
  was struck via CLICK_SRC's sign bit; the firmware maps that to left/right
  and dispatches the matching binding. `CONFIG_ZMK_MOTION_TAP_SIDE_INVERT`
  flips the mapping for upside-down builds.
- **`set_live_stream`** gates the `LiveState` notification. Studio turns it on
  only while the motion panel is open, because it's ~10 Hz traffic and BLE pays
  for it. Default off on connect.
- **`save_state`** persists both configs to flash; the setters take effect
  immediately but do not persist, matching how `lighting` behaves. Studio's
  header Save button calls it.
- **Unsupported.** Firmware without an IMU should leave the subsystem
  unregistered so the request fails with `RPC_NOT_FOUND`; Studio's probe treats
  that as "no motion features" and hides the section. Reporting
  `supports_* = false` instead also works.

## 3. Client generation

The frontend cannot put a `motion` request on the wire until
`@ph-design/zmk-studio-ts-client-fork` is regenerated from the updated
`zmk-studio-messages` submodule — ts-proto encoders silently drop unknown
fields. `clientSupportsMotion()` in `src/motion/motionRpc.ts` round-trips a
probe request through the codec and switches from the in-memory demo backend to
real RPC automatically once the regenerated client is installed. No frontend
change is needed at that point beyond the version bump.
